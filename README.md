# Web Application Security Template

Web Application Security Template is a Laravel based web application whose aim is to be used as a guideline/template when beginning a new web application.

**Disclaimer:** In no way shape or form am I stating that the code containing in this project results in a secure web application. This project is concistently being updated whilst I learn new security techniques. This area (along with Laravel) is new so the project is being used to document my progress on the topic. If you see anything glaringly wrong or any areas that could be improved, please do let me know.
